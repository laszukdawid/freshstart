# FreshStart

The repo is inteded to be a single place for easy machine setup.
All that's required is to have some shell (preferably bash).

Current use case: Fresh Ubuntu with bash.

## Usage

Execute `./freshstart_prep.sh` which installs all minimum dependencies, i.e. Task.
Then, execute `freshstart.sh` which uses the Task to install all software.
